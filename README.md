# Hyprland-on-Thinkpad-x1-Yoga
Installing and configuring hyprland on a thinkpad x1 yoga laptop on eos for maximum compatibility

To auto-rotate the screen you need to install iio-hypland `https://github.com/JeanSchoeller/iio-hyprland`

In vertical orientation, you need 2 configurations for the waybar, hyper and wofi (with/without external keyboard)

When creating the environment, I was inspired by windows and kde
